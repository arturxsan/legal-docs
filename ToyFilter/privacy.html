  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> October 25, 2025</p>
  <p>This Privacy Policy explains how Toybox handles user information when you use the app.</p>
  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Photos or Videos:</strong> When you use Toybox to create toy-style transformations, the app temporarily processes your uploaded image. This image may include faces but is not used for identification or recognition.</li>
    <li><strong>Identifiers and Purchases:</strong> We collect purchase data via RevenueCat to manage premium access.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>2. How We Use Your Data</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>To apply toy-style transformations using AI processing.</li>
    <li>To manage subscriptions and verify purchases.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We do not use your photos or any personal data for advertising, marketing, analytics, or tracking.</p>
  <h2>3. Face Data and Image Processing</h2>
  <p>Images containing faces are used only to generate toy-style transformations. The app does not perform facial recognition, identity verification, or biometric analysis. Face data is not stored or reused after processing.</p>
  <h2>4. Third-Party Data Processors</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>OpenAI API:</strong> Used to perform image transformation. Photos are securely transmitted via HTTPS to OpenAI's servers, processed to generate the transformed image, and handled in accordance with OpenAI's <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/data-usage-policies" target="_blank">Data Usage Policies</a>. OpenAI may retain API inputs and outputs for up to 30 days for abuse monitoring, after which they are permanently deleted.</li>
    <li><strong>RevenueCat:</strong> Used for managing in-app purchases and subscription validation.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>5. Data Retention</h2>
  <p>Photos and generated images are not stored by Toybox. Once processing is complete, they are discarded immediately. OpenAI may temporarily retain submitted data for up to 30 days for abuse detection and then deletes it. Purchase records are retained by RevenueCat according to their own data policies.</p>
  <h2>6. Security</h2>
  <p>All images and data transmitted between the app and third-party services are encrypted using HTTPS. We do not store images on our servers.</p>
  <h2>7. Your Rights</h2>
  <p>You may contact us to request deletion of your data or to ask questions about this policy.</p>
  <h2>8. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Updates will be published on this page with a new effective date.</p>
  <h2>9. Contact</h2>
